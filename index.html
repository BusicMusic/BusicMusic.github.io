   <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
   <p class="content">
	The purpose of this web page is pretty simple; to serve as a sort of hub for all the web pages that I've created and want to share with freinds and family over the internet. By creating this web page with links to other various pages my hope is to have a single website that has links to the other projects that I've created as a way to showcase my skillset. This and the other web pages are currently hosted through GitHub because it serves its purpose. Later on I hope to have my own website that <i>isn't</i> just an extension of GitHub.
   </p>
   <h2 id="todoList">Websites on my To-Do List</h2>
   <p class="content">
    Below are some websites that I've come up with and decided to create. I'll get to them eventually, and when I do I'll cross it off the list and upload it to github so people can access them
    <ul>
	 <li class="finished">A Website that serves as a home page for my online gaming group on Xbox Live that my friend and I founded</li>
	 <li class="finished">A Dice game based off of the game we see Will Tunrer play against Davy Jones in <i>Pirates of the Carribean: Dead Man's Chest</i></li>
	 <li class="finished">A Rock-Paper-Scissors themed card game that I saw being played in an anime called Kakegurui</li>
	 <li class="finished">A Dice game that is based off of a fighting game that was briefly seen in the Webtoon <i>Hardcor Leveling Warrior</i> available on the Line Webtoon application</li>
	 <li>A Go Fish Game that is played between You and a Computer</li>
	</ul>
   </p>
   <h2 id="aboutMe">About Me</h2>
   <p class="content">
    Basically, I'm a computer nerd. I'm very interested in computers in general. Videogames, Programming, Figuring out how stuff works, etc. In high school I took Graphic Arts, Programming, and Electronic Engineering classes to help me find something that I was passionate about and turn it in to a career. The Graphic Arts classes taught me a general understanding of Adobe PhotoShop as well as Adobe Illustrator. While taking the Programming classes I discovered that I loved learning how to program because it taught me a general understanding of all coding that I've come across. The Electronic Engineering classes were fun, but I didn't enjoy them as much as the programming aspect of computers. That helped me narrow down my choice of a career to: Programming. I like to think that with my Electronics background has given me a basic understanding of how circuit boards work. Plus, it ties in nicely with my interest in computers.
   </p>
   <p class="content">
    Once I decided to focus on programming as a career choice I started looking around for colleges that were nearby and offered a solid programming degree. This lead me to ECPI University, where I recieved my Bachelores in Software Development! While working towards the degree, I took classes for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that really sparked my interest in Web Development. I've taken the knowledge that I've gathered from those classes and created multiple websites; both for classes as 'final exams' and as personal projects that I thought would be cool to create.

	 <i>You can find links to all the finished and (hopefully) bug-free websites on the column to the left! If you want to contact me, sending me a message on Twitter would be the easiest way. However, if it's about a more professional matter, then you should already have my email address. I'm not putting my email address here because I'm not comfortable just throwing that out online for everyone to see.</i>
